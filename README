PREREQUISITES: 

A working installation of the fortune (fortune-mod) and cowsay 
utilities are required for this add-on to be of use. 
On a Debian-based Linux box (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.), these packages 
can be installed by running the following commands: 
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install cowsay fortunes fortune-mod fortunes-off
Other fortune-modded packages are found by issuing: 
    $ apt-cache search fortune
    $ apt-cache search cowsay
To install these utilities on Mac OSX, consult the following link: 
https://gist.github.com/evnm/1308428. 
Installation on any Windows variant is considered experimental and 
is unsupported. 

DOWNLOADING AND PACKAGE INSTALLATION: 

You need a working directory containing the files in the 
GitHub repository https://github.com/maxieds/math-fortune-mod.git: 
     => math.fortunes
     => Sigma.cow
     => install.sh
     => README (this document)
You can either copy each of these files directly from the 
web repository, or alternately, automate the process by running the 
following command from your favorite terminal: 
    $ git clone https://github.com/maxieds/math-fortune-mod.git
    $ cd math-fortune-mod
Next, the fortune and cow files are installed by running the 
provided install script (requires superuser privileges to copy the 
files into /usr/share/*): 
    $ sudo /bin/bash install.sh

The install script adds a line to your working ~/.bashrc file that 
will print a Sigma-symbol-spoken math joke or quote whenever you 
(re)start the terminal (try typing: $ source ~/.bashrc). Additionally, 
you can run the math fortune mod manually by issuing: 
    $ /usr/games/fortune math.fortunes | /usr/games/cowsay -f Sigma
