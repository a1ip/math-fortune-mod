Old mathematicians never die; they just lose some of their functions.

What is a rigorous definition of rigor? 
%
There is no logical foundation of mathematics, and GÃ¶del has proved it! 
%
I do not think -- therefore I am not.

Here is the illustration of this principle:
One evening Rene Descartes went to relax at a local tavern. The tender approached and said, "Ah, good evening Monsieur Descartes! Shall I serve you the usual drink?". Descartes replied, "I think not.", and promptly vanished.

A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn't there. (Charles R Darwin)
%
A statistician is someone who is good with numbers but lacks the personality to be an accountant.
%
Classification of mathematical problems as linear and nonlinear is like classification of the Universe as bananas and non-bananas. 
%
A law of conservation of difficulties: there is no easy way to prove a deep result. 
%
A tragedy of mathematics is a beautiful conjecture ruined by an ugly fact.
%
Algebraic symbols are used when you do not know what you are talking about.

Philosophy is a game with objectives and no rules.
Mathematics is a game with rules and no objectives.

Math is like love; a simple idea, but it can get complicated.

He who can properly define and divide is to be considered a god. (Plato) 
%
"God geometrizes" says Plato.

and here is the analytical continuation of this saying:

    Biologists think they are biochemists,
    Biochemists think they are Physical Chemists,
    Physical Chemists think they are Physicists,
    Physicists think they are Gods,
    And God thinks he is a Mathematician.

Physicists defer only to mathematicians, mathematicians defer only to God.
